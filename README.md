# Stata_Sample_Codes

This folder contains three Stata sample codes. Each smaple follows a different data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and analysis process for panel datasets used in macroeconomic and microeconomic data projects. These samples are meant to showcase my coding skills in Stata as applied to internartional development research and impact evaluation.
